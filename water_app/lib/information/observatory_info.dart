  static const String wois = "\nEuropean Space Agency's Water Observation Information System (WOIS):\n\nOverview:\n\nWOIS is a part of the ESA's Earth Observation Data Exploitation (EO-DE) program, and its primary focus is on monitoring water bodies, including lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, as well as supporting water resource management.\n\nKey Features:\n\nSatellite Data Integration: WOIS integrates data from various Earth observation satellites, providing a comprehensive view of global water resources. This data includes information on water quality, surface water extent, and changes over time.\n\nRemote Sensing Technologies: WOIS utilizes advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor parameters such as water temperature, water level, and water quality. This enables the observation of large water bodies and remote areas that are challenging to access on the ground.\n\nData Analysis and Modeling: The system employs data analysis techniques and modeling to interpret the satellite data, allowing for the identification of trends, anomalies, and potential issues related to water resources.\n\nDecision Support: WOIS provides valuable information to decision-makers, water resource managers, and researchers, supporting informed decision-making processes related to water management, conservation, and environmental protection.\n\nGlobal Coverage: One of the strengths of WOIS is its ability to provide global coverage, allowing for the monitoring of water resources on a large scale. This is particularly important for understanding transboundary water issues and addressing global water challenges.\n\nOpen Access: WOIS emphasizes open access to its data, promoting collaboration and information sharing among the global community. This facilitates the development of a collective understanding of water-related issues.";
