  static const String blueWhale = "\nThe blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, belonging to the baleen whale family. These majestic marine mammals can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weigh as much as 200 tons. Blue whales have a distinct blue-gray color and a relatively streamlined body with a flat, broad head. They are filter feeders, primarily consuming small shrimp-like animals called krill by taking in large gulps of water and then using their baleen plates to filter out the krill.\n\nBlue whales are known for their hauntingly beautiful songs, which are among the loudest sounds produced by any animal. They are found in oceans around the world, with different populations occupying various regions. Despite their enormous size, blue whales are generally gentle giants, and their conservation status is categorized as endangered due to historical whaling activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve these magnificent creatures.";
